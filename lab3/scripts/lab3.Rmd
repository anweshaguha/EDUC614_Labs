# Create large random sample. Call it the population.
## Report population descriptive statistics (mean, sd, skew, kurtosis)
## Ask students to create a histogram of data
## note: ideally population is skewed -- initial thought is to manipulate seed to get most skewed data, but there is probably a better way

# Randomly sample with n = 10 (or less), calculate the mean and sd
## Do this 30 times (maybe we can write a loop for them?)
## Create histogram of sampling distribution & report descriptive stats
## What do you expect the mean and sd of the hypothetical sampling distribution to be if you did it infinte times instead of 30?

## Check the code above by drawing 1,000,000 random samples of size of 10 from population
## Calculate descriptive stats. Do they match with population? Why or why not?
