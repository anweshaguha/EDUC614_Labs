# Intro
This week we will go over descriptive statistics.

Note: **All material is taken from Dr. Zopluoglu's 2021 EDUC 614 materials and adapted for this year's course.**

We have adapted it to slide format using R.
Want to learn how we created R slide presentations? [This tutorial](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/09/mastering-r-presentations/) is helpful.

## Importing Data
There are many ways of importing data into R depending on your taste and style. 
In class, you practiced how to import data using `Import Dataset` functionality under the Environment tab. 

If you want to follow along, go ahead and import the *Add.csv* file into R following the same instructions. 

Make sure you name the data object as *Add* because the rest of the code will assume your data object name in the Environment is Add.

## Importing Data

In addition, I would also like to show you how you can import the same file with base functions using syntax. Below is how you can import the Add.csv file using the `read.csv` function. For more information, you can type `?read.csv` in the R console and read more about how to use this function.
